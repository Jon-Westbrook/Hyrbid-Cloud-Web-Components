title: Use squash commit for feature branches
deck: Commits made during development of a task pollute the `development` and `main` branches
---

Developers commit often and for various reasons while working on a feature
branch. This has value in explaining how a particular task was developed.
However, once the work is merged it loses importance. Excess of commits in the
release branches `development` and `main` create confusion and complicate
roll-backs, hotfixes, and cherry-picks.

## Decision

We will squash and merge pull requests into the `development` branch. This will
create a single commit ([using conventional commits](./20220513-use-conventional-commits))
for each pull request in the `development` branch.

## Consequences

We can trace the work relating to a particular ticket to a single commit. This
will make our code history more readable and easier to alter when needed.
