title: Use Conventional Commits for mainline commits
deck: Unstructured commit messages are confusing and work against tooling.

---
<!-- Here begins Markdown and HTML -->
## Decision
Commits going against the `development` and `main` branches will conform
to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification.
<!-- Write the decision here -->
<!-- Headings will be shown in a table of contents with links -->

##  Consequences
Commits on the `development` and `main` branch will explain better the
history of the project. Additionally tools like semantic release, will
be able to parse the commits to infer release versions.
<!-- What has to be done now that we've made the decision? -->
<!-- How will this impact us or our clients? -->
