title: Use Conventional Commits for mainline commits
deck: Unstructured commit messages are confusing and work against tooling.
---

## Decision

Commits going against the `development` and `main` branches will conform
to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification.

## Consequences

Commits on the `development` and `main` branch will explain better the
history of the project. Additionally tools like semantic release, will
be able to parse the commits to infer release versions.
