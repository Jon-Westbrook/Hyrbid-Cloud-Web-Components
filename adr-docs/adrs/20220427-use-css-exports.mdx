title: Allow widgets to use stylesheets
deck: CSS-in-JS solutions are not easily compatible with carbon components.

Use of carbon utility classes and carbon components makes it very difficult to use emotion or other CSS-in-JS solutions. Imported components that we need to use do not use CSS-in-JS, this leads to emitting CSS files during compilation.

## Decision

We allow export CSS files as part of the widget compilation process. This typically will result in a `css/main.css` file in the widget output.

## Consequences

We will increase efficiency by re-using carbon components and UI helpers developed by other teams.
