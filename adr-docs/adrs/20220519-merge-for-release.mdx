title: Use merge for promoting the sandbox to production.
deck: We want to retain development history for our production branch.
---

## Decision

We will merge the `development` branch onto the `main` branch in order to
promote the sandbox repository to production. We will use the GitHub user
interface, because that will leave the closed pull request as papertrail of the
promotion.

After every production hotfix, we will create a pull request from `main` to
`development`. We will also resolve this pull request with a merge commit.

## Consequences

We can compare the history of the sandbox and production registries. We can test
potential hotfixes on sandbox first, because both branches have related stories.
