title: Use Format.JS for internationalization
deck: React applications in the registry need to display interface text in multiple languages.
---

IBM serves content in many languages and locales. We need a tool to render translated text in the language selected for the page embedding the widget.

## Decision

We will use Format.JS to display translations in widgets. For react we will use `react-intl` which uses Format.JS.

### Considerations

The following have played a significant role in choosing this library over others:

  - There are wrappers for different frameworks: these include React and Web Components.
  - There is an existing opinionated [translation workflow](https://formatjs.io/docs/getting-started/application-workflow) we can follow.
  - It is a popular choice: it uses standard document formats for translations, it has very good community support, well maintained, and includes detailed documentation.

## Consequences

The interface text for widgets can be translated according to a documented workflow, and can be displayed in the correct language.
