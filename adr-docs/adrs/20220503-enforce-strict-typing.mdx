title: Enforce Strict Types for TypeScript Code
deck: Missing types often hide uncovered execution paths that can lead to bugs.
---

Use of TypeScript is beneficial to the project even without explicit use of the typing system. Type inference by the
compiler already provides much value and improves developer experience. This helps to avoid bugs integrating with the
JavaScript framework of choice. However, type inference alone does not help with business logic. We will need to add our types for that.

## Decision

Forbid the use of non-types like `any` via automation tools. Improper typing will result errors that will prevent
merging the work.

### Implementation Suggestions

The recommended approach is using ESLint. Add the `'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended'` plugin. This will include the following rules (among others): `'@typescript-eslint/no-empty-function'`, `'@typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface'`, `'@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any'`.

## Consequences

The code we produce in the widget system will be more robust, leading to fewer defects and higher efficiency in the quality assurance and development phases.
