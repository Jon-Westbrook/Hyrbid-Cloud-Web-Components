title: Record architecture decisions
deck: Lack of architectural documentation leads to technical debt and inefficiencies when key contributors disengage a project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](https://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

Our architecture decisions will be recorded and displayed using the [ADR Gatsby theme](https://www.github.com/Lullabot/gatsby-theme-adr). This will allow newcomers to understand the reasons behind the technical decisions.
