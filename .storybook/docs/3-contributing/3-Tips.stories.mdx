# Development Tips

This page contains development tips and conventions in this project.

## 1. Translations

This project uses react-intl to translate the interface strings. To make your widget multilingual:

- When rendering text on English, wrap it with a `<FormattedMessage>`. Running
  `yarn lint:fix` will generate a unique ID for you. This ID is an alphanumeric code that changes when the default message
  changes to ensure translations are up to date. For instance:

```jsx
import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl';
// ...
<FormattedMessage
  defaultMessage="There was a problem loading Trust Radius reviews. Please try again later."
  id="problems"
/>;
```

- Once you have your app ready for translation, execute the script `./scripts/extract-all.sh my-widget-id`. This will scan for the messages in the widget `my-widget-id` and put them in each of the `./src/apps/my-widget-id/locales/extractedStrings` folder. You can use the `en.json` file to submit the string for translation. Once you get the translated JSON files (`es.json`, `ja.json`, ...) add them to the `extractedStrings` folder.
- Before publishing your widget remember to "compile" the translations using `./scripts/compile-all.sh`.

After following those steps the CI deployment will upload the translations to Cloud Object Storage under: https://your-cos-url/translations/your-widget.

**TIP:** if you want to check your translations locally (while running the app with `yarn start`) compile them, then copy the JSON files into `<root>/public/translations/<widget-id>/`. This is not needed if you are only looking at Storybook.

## 2. Using media

You can use images and other media assets normally within your application. Webpack will take care of inlining the assets if necessary. A possible way of doing this is:

```jsx
import imgData from '../assets/img/the-image.png';
// ...
<img src={imgData} alt="..." />;
```

Another way to add media is by putting it in the per-widget `public` directory. Lets say you store an image under `./src/apps/your-widget/public/foo/bar/my-image.png`. You can then reference in you code using:

```
<img src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL}/your-widget/foo/bar/my-image.png`} alt="..." />
```

Travis will ensure that the image is uploaded to a public location, while Webpack will be in charge of replacing the string `'process.env.PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL'` with the actual URL when compiling the code (also in Travis). In coordination to that the `.env.local` file in you local environment should contain `PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL=/static`, so the media also works in Storybook.

**Importing images directly into the component is encouraged**, but the `public` folder can be used when there are an abundance of images. See [Using the Public Folder](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder/) from the `create-react-app` documentation for more suggestions on when to use the `public` folder.

# Shared code and features

One of the main benefits of aggregating all the widgets under the same repository is sharing code. The following section lists some potential shared code structures.

## 1. Story management

All widgets **must** include stories. In order to simplify the creation process of a story we have developed two decorators:

- `storyWithTranslation()`: this helper will ease the process of adding i18n support for your stories.
- `storyWithRedux()`: this helper will ease the process of setting the exact (redux) state you need for rendering your story.

## 2. Static assets

This codebase generates several applications:

- Storybook in the developer's local.
- Storybook in the Tugboat preview.
- Storybook as served from Cloud Object Storage.
- The widget code in the Tugboat preview.
- The widget for the production/sandbox registy.

With this disparity of hosting infrastructure we need an abstraction for how to reference static assets for the widgets that all these applications can use. Examples of static assets include binary images, fonts, PDF files, etc. Use static assets for situations where you don't want to bundle these binaries with the JS bundle.

In order to ensure that all the applications can access the assets the developer will use an evironment variable `$PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL`. Each application has been configured to translate that into the appropriate URL. See section `2. Using media` above for more details.

You can find this configuration in `./storybook/main.js` in the `staticDirs` section. And in the `./scripts/ci/upload-public-dirs-to-cos.sh`.

The following code will work in all the applications described above:

```tsx
<img src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL}/trust-radius/img/logo.png`} />
```

Note that in this example `logo.png` will be stored under `./src/apps/trust-radius/public/img/logo.png`.

For more information you can check `upload-public-dirs-to-cos.sh`.

## 3. Shared Typescript types

Use of **TypeScript is required** for contributing to the Widget Registry. For the most part, contributors will need to write their own types as the apps are independent from one another.

Widgets share some common features, therefore they share some helper code and TypeScript types. This covers things like language codes, color palettes for [Carbon design](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/), widget render function types, etc.

You can find these types in the `./types` folder. Make sure to scan its contents before writing your types. We want to **standarize types across widgets** whenever possible.

## 4. Shared Functionality

There are some tasks that are common across all widgets, this is despite the fact that widgets are independent from one another. These include tasks like downloading translation files, massaging the widget input variables, dealing with common state management (like view port resize, changing the widget color scheme, etc.).

If a piece of code is shared among two or more widgets, it should be moved up to the `./common` folder. Your widget **should not** import code from another widget's code base.

## 5. Compile Widgets Locally
Once your widget shows properly in Storybook you need to ensure that it will compile properly. If a widget does not compile properly it will not function in the CSM.

```console
# Set ups environment variables, like in the CI environment. Do this once per session.
export PUBLIC_URL="https://hybrid-cloud-widgets-development.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud"
export PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL="https://hybrid-cloud-widgets-development.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/static"

# Re-set the output directory between runs. Do this every compilation
rm --recursive --force widget-registry
mkdir widget-registry
# Run the compiler over the local code-base.
npx @js-widgets/webpack-cli \
  --existing-registry="${PUBLIC_URL}/registry.json" \
  --output-dir="$(pwd)/widget-registry" \
  "$(pwd)" --debug
```

## 6. Styling a Widget
Given that widgets can be embedded anywhere, and CSS is inherently global to the page, it makes sense to use a CSS-in-JS technology in your widgets. For this reason we **require the use of [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)** to accept contributed widgets. Take a peek at the Trust Radius widget to see emotion used in a widget.
